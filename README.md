[Clustered](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-oiB0KPuBF-clustered) specializes in assisting users in creating thematic clusters of OpenAI custom GPTs from the Sourceduty custom GPT repository. It guides users through selecting relevant custom GPTs to assemble into cohesive groups based on specific objectives or domains, such as education, creative work, technical support, or other specialized tasks. By narrowing down the options in the repository based on user-defined criteria, this GPT provides a streamlined approach to organizing multiple GPTs into tailored "clusters" that can work together to achieve specific goals. It leverages the Sourceduty repository as a source of GPT options, ensuring that every recommended tool aligns with the user's intended functionality.

Through a step-by-step, question-based refinement process, this custom GPT helps users clarify their cluster requirements by prompting them to describe their primary goals and any necessary criteria. As it gathers relevant preferences, it fetches, filters, and presents a refined list of suitable GPTs from the Sourceduty repository, including direct links for easy access. This makes it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to leverage AI tools in a structured, collaborative manner, supporting targeted workflows with carefully selected AI capabilities designed to operate harmoniously as a custom suite of solutions.
